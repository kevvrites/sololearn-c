--------------------------------------------
Strings
A string in C is an array of characters that ends with a NULL character '\0'
A string declaration can be made in multiple ways.

char str_name[str_len] = "string";
Creates a string named str_name with str_len characters and initializes it to the value of "string"
Compiler automatically adds NULL character to char array when string literal is provided
The array size must be at least one character longer than the expected string length
If the declaration does not have a str_len, then it will be automatically calculated on the input

Strings can also be declared as a set of characters:
char str3[6] = {'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'};

NULL character must be added explicitly, characters are in single quotes.
The name of a string acts as a pointer.
A string literal is a text enclosed in double quotation marks.
A character cannot be treated as a string.

String pointer declaration such as char *str = "stuff"; is considered a constant andcannot be changed

Standard Library string functions:
#include <string.h>
strlen()    get length of string
strcat()    merge two strings
strcpy()    copy one string to Another
strlwr()    convert string to lower case
strupr()    convert string to upper case
strrev()    reverse string
strcmp()    compare two strings

String Input
To retrieve a line of text or string from user, use scanf() and fgets() functions.
scanf() reads inputs based on format specifiers. No need for & to access the address
To read up to a specified number of characters, use fgets().
Using fgets() over gets() prevents buffer overflow, which happens when the array isn't big enough for the input.

fgets(string_name, char_length, pointer)
stdin is standard input, from the keyboard
The newline character is stored by fgets.
fgets() reads only n-1 characters from stdin because there must be room for '\0'

String Output
fputs(), puts(), and printf() handles string output

fputs() requires the name of the string and a pointer to where the string is output
To print the the screen, use stdout (standard output)

puts() takes a string argument can also be used to display output
It adds a newline to output

printf() prints an input to the screen
--------------------------------------------
String Functions
A formatted string can be created with sprintf() function. Useful for building a string from other data types.

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    char info[100];
    char dept[] = "HR";
    int emp = 75;
    sprintf(info, "The %s dept has %d employees.", dept, emp);
    printf("%s\n", info);

    return 0;
}

sscanf() is useful for scanning a string for values.
The function reads values from a string and stores them at the corresponding variable addresses.

The string.h library contains a lot of string functions.

strlen(str)             Returns the length of the string stored in str, not including the NULL character.
strcat(str1, str2)      Appends str2 to the end of str1 and returns a pointer to str1
strcpy(str1, str2)      Copies str2 to str1.
strncat(str1, str2, n)  Appends first n characters of str2 to the end of str1 and returns a pointer to str1.
strncpy(str1, str2, n)  Copies the first n characters of str2 to str1.
strcmp(str1, str2)      Returns 0 when str1 is equal to str2, less than 0 when str1 < str2, and greater than 0 when str1 > str2.
strncmp(str1, str2, n)  Returns 0 when the first n characters of str1 is equal to the first n characters of str2, less than 0 when str1 < str2, and greater than 0 when str1 > str2.
strchr(str1, c)         Returns a pointer to the first occurence of character c in str1, or NULL if the character not found.
strrchr(str1, c)        Searches str1 in reverse and returns a pointer to the position of character c in str1, or NULL if character not found.
strstr(str1, str2)      Returns a pointer to the first occurence of str2 in str1, or NULL if str2 not found.

stdio.h library contains functions for converting a string to a number:
int atoi(str)       ASCII to integer. Converts str to the equivalent int value. 0 is returned if the first character is not a number or no numbers are encountered.
double atof(str)    ASCII to float. Converts str to the equivalent double value. 0.0 is returned if the first character is not a number or no numbers are encountered.
long int atol(str)  ASCII to long int. Converts str to the equivalent long integer value. 0 is returned if the first character is not a number or no numbers are encountered.

atoi() lacks error handling, so recommended to use strtol() to ensure proper error handling.

A two-dimensional array can be used to store related strings. The sizes should be large enough to hold the longest string.
It can be cumbersome to access the elements.
Easier way to deal with a collection of related strings is with an array of pointers.
The array of string pointers has a more ragged structure. There is no limit to string length, and items can be referred to by a pointer in the first character for each string.
The actual strings are being referenced by these pointers.
--------------------------------------------
Function Pointers
Function pointers point to executable code for a function in memory.
Function pointers can be stored in an array or passed as arguments to other functions.

A function pointer declaration uses the * like other pointers.
return_type (*func_name)(parameters)

The parentheses around (*func_name) are important. Otherwise, the compiler will think the function is RETURNING a pointer.
After declaration, assignment to a function is next.

#include <stdio.h>
void say_hello(int num_times); // function

int main() {
    void (*funptr)(int); // function pointer
    funptr = say_hello; // pointer assignment
    funptr(3); //function call

    return 0;
}

void say_hello(int num_times) {
    int k;
    for (k = 0; k < num_times; k++)
        printf("Hello\n");
}

A function name points to the start of the executable code.
It isn't necessary to include & and * in the function assignment and call.

An array of function pointers can replace a switch or an if statement for choosing an action.

#include <stdio.h>
int add(int num1, int num2);
int subtract(int num1, int num2);
int multiply(int num1, int num2);
int divide(int num1, int num2);

int main()
{
    int x, y, choice, result;
    int (*op[4])(int, int);

    op[0] = add;
    op[1] = subtract;
    op[2] = multiply;
    op[3] = divide;
    printf("Enter two integers: ");
    scanf("%d%d", &x, &y);
    printf("Enter 0 to add, 1 to subtract, 2 to multiply, or 3 to divide: ");
    scanf("%d", &choice);
    result = op[choice](x, y);
    printf("%d", result);

    return 0;
}

int add(int x, int y) {
    return(x + y)
}

int subtract(int x, int y) {
    return(x - y)
}

int multiply(int x, int y) {
    return(x * y)
}

int divide(int x, int y) {
    if (y != 0)
        return (x / y);
    else
        return 0;
}

The statement int(*op[4])(int, int); declares the array of function pointers.
Functions assigned to the array have two int parameters and return an int.
result = op[choice](x,y); executes the function based on the choice
--------------------------------------------
void Pointer
A void pointer is used to refer to any address type in memory and has a declaration that looks like: void *ptr;
When dereferencing a void pointer, you must first type cast the pointer to the appropriate data type before dereferencing with *.

int x = 33;
float y = 12.4;
char c = 'a';
void *ptr;

ptr = &x;
printf("void ptr points to %d\n", *((int *)ptr));
ptr = &y;
printf("void ptr points to %f\n", *((float *)ptr));
ptr = &c;
printf("void ptr points to %c", *((char *)ptr));

You cannot perform arithmetic with void pointers.

Void pointers are often used for function declarations.
void * square (const void *);

Using a void * return type allows for any return type.
Parameters that are void * accept any argument type.
If you want to use data without changing it, declare it const.
Leave out parameter name to further insulate the declaration from implementation. Declaring a function this way allows the definition to be customized as needed.

#include <stdio.h>

void* square (const void* num);

int main() {
    int x, sq_int;
    x = 6;
    sq_int = square(&x);
    printf("%d squared is %d\n", x, sq_int);

    return 0;
}

void* square (const void *num) {
    int result;
    result = (*(int *)num) * (*(int *) num);
    return result;
}

The square function has been written to multiply ints, whch is why the num void pointer is cast to an int.
If the implementation needs to allow multiplication of floats, then only the definition needs to be changed.

Pass a function pointer to another function.
A function pointer used as an argument is referred to as a "callback function" because the receiving function calls it back.

qsort() function in stdlib.h header uses this technique.

Quicksort is a widely used algorithm for sorting an array. Include the stdlib.h file and write a compare function that matches the declaration used in qsort.

void qsort(void *base, size_t num, size_t width, int (compare)(const void *, const void *))
void *base  A void pointer to the array
size_t num  The number of elements in the array
size_t width    The size of an element
int (*compare (const void *, const void *)) A function pointer which has two arguments and returns 0 when the arguments have the same value, < 0 when arg1 comes before arg2, and >0 when arg1 comes after arg2.
