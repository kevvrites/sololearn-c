# sololearn-c
By Kevin Liu \
I am attempting to learn C using the iPad version of Sololearn. I will be including course notes throughout this repository. The date next to the section is the date of completion (MM/DD/YYYY).

### Sololearn
SoloLearn is a free online resource for software engineers who are looking to learn a new programming language from scratch. They have tracks in 13 languages, including Python, HTML, CSS, SQL, and JavaScript.

### C
C is a general-purpose programming language that has been around for nearly 50 years. C has been used to write everything from operating systems (including Windows and many others) to complex programs like the Python interpreter, Git, Oracle database, and more. The versatility of C is by design. It is a low-level language that relates closely to the way machines work while still being easy to learn. 

Starting Point: I have no experience with C.
